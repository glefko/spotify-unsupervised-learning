# Spotify Unsupervised Learning

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to explore **clustering methods** in the context of music data.  
By applying **Unsupervised Learning**, music tracks will be grouped based on their characteristics, enabling the development of a simple **Recommendation System**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is provided by [**Spotify**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset) and contains tracks from **125 music genres**.  
Each track is described by **21 features**, which will be used to cluster the tracks into a meaningful number of groups.

---

## ⚙️ Task Description

- Apply clustering algorithms to group tracks based on their feature values.  
- Experiment with different numbers of clusters to achieve meaningful groupings.  
- Evaluate clustering quality and interpretability.  
- Use the clusters to build a basic **music recommendation system**.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

This project applies **Unsupervised Learning**, specifically clustering techniques, to discover hidden patterns in the dataset without labeled outcomes.
